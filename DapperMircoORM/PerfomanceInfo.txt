A key feature of Dapper is performance. The following metrics show how long it takes to execute 500 SELECT statements against a DB and map the data returned to objects.

The performance tests are broken in to 3 lists:

POCO serialization for frameworks that support pulling static typed objects from the DB. Using raw SQL.
Dynamic serialization for frameworks that support returning dynamic lists of objects.
Typical framework usage. Often typical framework usage differs from the optimal usage performance wise. Often it will not involve writing SQL.
